# P2P2P2P
Place, Person, Powers, Peers
(A personal DAT site.)

## Getting Started

### What you'll need

- Your computer
- Your imagination
- Your determination
- [Beaker Browser](dat://beakerbrowser.com) (an experimental peer to peer web browser)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) or [Atom](https://atom.io) (a text editor -- optional)

### How to edit files within the Beaker Browser

If you don't download a text editor, you can still get by because Beaker Browser allows you to edit files right within the browser. To edit a file you own:

- Open the Beaker Browser
- Find your file in your [Library](beaker://library/)
- Select the `Edit file` icon in the upper right corner of the form
- Make edits and select `Save` in the upper right corner of the form when complete

### Our template

First, we imagined what a profile might look like on the peer to peer web.

Then we created this template:
[dat://ccf84a6f345f0b2c978067262da642d7ccd10c68e68d79f956fc1a117c901e8d/](dat://ccf84a6f345f0b2c978067262da642d7ccd10c68e68d79f956fc1a117c901e8d/)

To add our template to your Library on Beaker, you need to seed it.

To seed, press the seeding icon (looks like a sideways V) and slide the seeder over to the right. "Seed these files" ... "Forever"

## How to make your own P2P2P2P site

### PART A ... Imagine your world

Answer the following questions in a document or on separate sheet of paper:

**1. PLACE.**
**Where are you? Describe your world, home, or living place.**
*Create your place. It can be based on real life, imagination, or anything in between.*

1.1 (index) In one word, where do you live?
1.2 What is it like?
1.3 How would you decorate your environment and why?

**2. PERSON.**
**Who are you? Describe yourself.**
*Create yourself. Consider yourself in the place you created.*

2.1 What would you like people to call you in this place?
2.2 What is your source of nutrients? What animates you?
2.3 When do you come up with your best ideas?

**3. POWERS**
**What can you do? Describe your talents, skills, or powers.**
*Add your attributes. It can be based on real life, imagination, or anything in between.*

3.1 What is your hobby or favorite subject(s) to learn?
3.2 What do you collect? If you don’t collect anything what did you last acquire?
3.3 Name one skill or special power you have or one you’d like to have.

**4. PEERS**
**Who lives near you? Describe your neighborhood.**
*Create your neighborhood. Consider the people and places you like to visit.*

4.1 Who is left and right of you?
4.2 Where do you like to visit?
4.3 How would you like others to contact you?

### PART B ... Build your world

Add the information from the questions matching the .html files. (ex. 1.2 to 1-2.html). Look for the comments `<!-- Add your info here -->` for suggested places to customize your P2P2P2P site.

To add photos place photos in the `images` folder.

To add links to your friends on (4-1.html) you'll need to either have them make their own P2P2P2P dat site or if they have one you'll need to get their dat link directly from them.

If you'd like to change the colors or fonts or anything visual, open up `style.css` and edit.

### Optional

Add photos or other other information in secondary boxes to further personalize the P2P2P2P site.

Challenge: Try to make the P2P2P2P site file size as small as possible while maintaining the vision of your P2P2P2P site.
